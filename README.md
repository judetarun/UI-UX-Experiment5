# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim: 
To Present 2 different UX project scenarios (e.g., designing a health app, an e-commerce site, or a government service portal).

## Algorithm:
1. Identifying and Writing Problem Statements
 Identify user pain points.
 Write 1–2 clear UX problem statements using a defined template:
 "[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."

2. Identifying Appropriate Research Methods
 Identify the most suitable research methods (e.g., surveys, interviews, usability testing, diary studies).
 Justify your method choice.
3. Creating Personas
 Based on previous user data or a given user scenario.
 Create at least two user personas with:
 Demographics
 Goals
 Behaviors
 Pain points
 Motivation

Scenario 1: Designing a Mobile Health App for Chronic Condition Management
1. Problem Statements
User Pain Points:
● Users struggle to track symptoms consistently.
● They forget to take medication or log entries.

Problem Statements:
1. "Chronic illness patients need a way to consistently track their symptoms and medication because they often forget or feel overwhelmed, which results in incomplete data and ineffective health management."
2. "Users managing long-term conditions need a way to visualize trends over time because current tools are fragmented or manual, which results in a lack of actionable insights and poorer communication with doctors."
2. Appropriate Research Methods
Selected Methods:
● Interviews: Understand individual experiences, routines, and pain points in-depth.
● Diary Studies: Capture real-life usage patterns and daily struggles over a week or more.
Justification:
● Chronic condition management is highly personal; interviews reveal emotional and behavioral context.
